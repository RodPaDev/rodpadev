# hi, i'm patrick r. 🧑‍💻

3 things about me in analphabetic order:

- i love programming, especially making tools (go is my jam).
- i'm a refactor king and gracefully dive into legacy code (i don't get lost in the sauce).
- into long-term projects and weird side quests (i’ve never finished skyrim’s main quest).

📚 [rodpa.dev/blog](https://rodpa.dev/blog) — if you want to read some of my writing (it isn’t great writing, but i’m working on it).

i build cli apps, tuis, custom electronics, and questionable ideas.  
most of my code never reaches github.

> **note 2**: i'm finally giving a split ortholinear keyboard a try. i now type at the speed of your grandma
