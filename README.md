# Hi, I'm Patrick R. 🧑‍💻

3 things about me in analphabetic order

- I love programming, especially making tools, especially using Go.
- I'm a refactor king and I gracefully dive into legacy-code (i don't get lost in the sauce).
- Into long-term projects and weird side quests (i have never finished skyrim's main quest).

📚 [rodpa.dev/blog](https://rodpa.dev/blog) – if you want to read some of my writing (it isn't great writing, but I'm working on it.)

I love making CLI apps, TUIs, custom electronics, and questionable ideas.  
Most of my code never reaches GitHub.
