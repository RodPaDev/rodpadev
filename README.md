3 things about me in promiscuous order (idk how to count):
- i use vim btw (i'm ashamed to admit i still use vscode for work bcs haven't reached speed)
- i love programming, especially making tools (go is my ho)
- i find joy in cursed refactors. the worse the code, the better. i will 100% insult whoever wrote it (past me included)
- long-term projects with scaling issues give me wet dreams. side quests make me go brr brr. 
- i've still never finished skyrim's main quest

📚 [rodpa.dev/blog](https://rodpa.dev/blog) — if you want to read some of my writing (it’s not great, but the snail keeps crawling)

i build cli apps, tuis, custom electronics, and questionable ideas.  
most of my code rots locally, never seeing the light of github.
